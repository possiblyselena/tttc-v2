# TTTC-v2 Trash Throwing Trash Can!
At Scrapyard, I had the funny idea in which, what if your trash can threw trash back at you? Therefore we made the Trash Talking Trash Can, a trash can that would roast you every time you would throw out trash. Now that Highway is coming, what if the trash can actually threw trash? This trash can would know once someone throws something out and spits out the trash back at them (and is driveable cuz why not).
