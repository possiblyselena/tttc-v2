## May 15 - Project Planning
So, this is where I start researching into parts and how I can make this project actually interesting. 
I would like to use this project to bring more excitment to the Hack CLub at my school.
So that's why I want it to be able to move around, making it more interactive. I looked at different motors and how I could approach creating this, making my BOM. 
I've used Arudinos before and I am actually programing an FTC robot for my computering engineering right now, so I can apply some of the logic between the projects.
Now next time, I'd want to CAD some stuff and layout my componets to see what my project would look like!
